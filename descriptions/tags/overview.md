Reference documentation for the Tray.io Embedded GraphQL APIs

Please visit our <a href="https://tray.io/documentation/embedded/getting-started/overview/" target="_blank">Tray Embedded Documentation</a> to
familiarize yourself with Tray Embedded and learn how it can help you put the automation power of
<a href="https://tray.io/" target="_blank">Tray.io</a> in the hands of your End Users.

Use the examples with queries and mutations and the associated code samples to test out scripts using different input/filter criteria (e.g. 'Get User by Id' or 'Get Solution Instances by owner')

You can also click ['Run in Postman'](#tag/postmanCollection) button below to import and run the collection in your local Postman app. You can also try out our [Insomnia Http Client
collection](https://tray.io/documentation/embedded/embedded-apis/insomnia-collection/) as a local testing environment.

<strong>Note:</strong> The Tray GraphQL API is a backend API only and calls must be invoked server-side. Client-side Javascript calls
to the API should not be made as they will be blocked by CORS.</p> 
<p>Our <a href="https://tray.io/documentation/embedded/an-integration-walkthrough/run-the-demo-app/" target="_blank">demo
app</a> (built using <a href="https://www.apollographql.com/" target="_blank">Apollo GraphQL</a>) is a good illustration of how you can create a UI
which presents an End User with their available Solutions while making all API calls server-side - using a button to
hand over the Solution Instance configuration to our End User Config Wizard in a pop-up or iframe.
