Tray.io supports multiple regions to manage your end users.

The `base_url` for all requests would change depending on the region your Tray account is in. This is indicated in the URL of the Tray app. For US (default), your Tray app URL is `app.tray.io`, for EU `app.eu1.tray.io` and for APAC, it is `app.ap1.tray.io`.

Here is the list of `base_url` for the Embedded APIs:

Tray operates in 3 segregated AWS regions:

| Region              | Base URL                    |
| ------------------- | --------------------------- |
| US (AWS-West)       | https://tray.io/graphql     |
| EU (AWS-Ireland)    | https://eu1.tray.io/graphql |
| APAC (AWS-Sydney)   | https://ap1.tray.io/graphql |
